/**
* A stack-allocated class that governs a number of local handles.
* After a handle scope has been created, all local handles will be
* allocated within that handle scope until either the handle scope is
* deleted or another handle scope is created.  If there is already a
* handle scope and a new one is created, all allocations will take
* place in the new handle scope until it is deleted.  After that,
* new handles will again be allocated in the original handle scope.
*
* After the handle scope of a local handle has been deleted the
* garbage collector will no longer track the object stored in the
* handle and may deallocate it.  The behavior of accessing a handle
* for which the handle scope has been deleted is undefined.
